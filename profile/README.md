## ✨ Horizon drive ✨
Welcome to Horizon Drive, your free and open-source drive solution and more!

### Objectives
At Horizon Drive, we are driven by a set of core objectives that guide our mission:
 - **Connect Users Globally**: We aim to connect users from all corners of the world, fostering collaboration and communication
 - **Open Source Philosophy**: We are committed to using free and open-source software, ensuring that our platform remains accessible and customizable for everyone.
 - **Free Access for All**: Our services are designed to be freely accessible to all users, eliminating barriers and ensuring equal opportunities for everyone.
 - **Community-Driven**: We encourage and welcome contributions from anyone who shares our vision, making Horizon Drive a collaborative project built by its community.
 - **Transparency**: We believe in full transparency in our operations, from our codebase to our decision-making processes, to build trust and accountability.

### Flaws
While Horizon Drive strives for excellence, we acknowledge some potential flaws:
 - **Pricing**: We offer free plans to ensure accessibility, but this mean that Horizon Drive does not generate revenue by selling personal information. We are actively exploring sustainable ways to maintain and improve our services without compromising user privacy.
 - **Limited Features**: As a project in its early stages, Horizon Drive may have limitations in terms of features compared to commercial alternatives. We are continuously working to expand our feature set.
 - **Security**: Ensuring robust security measures is a top priority for us, but open-source projects can sometimes be vulnerable to security threats if not properly maintained. We rely on our community to help identify and address security issues promptly.
 - **Performance**: During peak usage times, you might experience occasional slowdowns or brief periods of downtime. We're actively optimizing performance to provide a smoother experience.
 - **User Experience**: While we are committed to improving the user interface and overall user experience, please understand that the platform's design might not be as polished as commercial alternatives, especially in the early stages of development.

We believe in addressing these flaws transparently and are dedicated to making Horizon Drive a better platform with the help of our community.

### Projects
Our Horizon Drive ecosystem consists of several projects, each catering to different aspects of your digital life:
 - **Connect (Accounts)**: Connect allows users to create accounts across all Horizon Drive services. Additionally, it offers OAuth APIs for websites that wish to intergrate with our open-source platform, promoting a decentralized and user-centric web.
 - **Drive (Files)**: Drive is your secure, personal storage space on Horizon Drive, offering 10GB of free storage to all users. Rest assured, your files are fully encrypted, prioritizing your data privacy and security.

Join us on this exciting journey as we work towards creating a more connected, open, and accessible digital world. Together, we can drive change and build a brighter digital horizon.
